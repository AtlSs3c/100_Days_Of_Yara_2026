1st time #100DaysOfYara journey - learning, practicing and documenting progress

This repository documents my journey through **#100DaysOfYARA** inspired by Yashraj Solanki https://x.com/RustyNoob619/status/2006398126278443141?s=20.
I am learning YARA from scratch, practicing every day, and building confidence in detection thinking and rule writing.

This repo is about learning, improving, and showing progression honestly.
